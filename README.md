Movie Recommendation System 🎬

A personalized movie recommendation system built to suggest movies based on user preferences and viewing history. This project leverages collaborative and content-based filtering techniques to provide accurate and relevant recommendations.

🚀 Features

Hybrid Recommendation: Combines collaborative filtering and content-based filtering to recommend movies that match user preferences.
Interactive Suggestions: Users can input their favorite movies to get similar recommendations.
Extensible Framework: Built to support additional data sources and algorithms in the future.

📂 Dataset

This project uses the kaggle dataset as the primary data source. The dataset includes movie ratings, genres, and user information, ideal for building recommendation systems.

📑 Project Structure

data/: Contains the dataset files used in this project.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model development, and evaluation.
src/: Source code for the recommendation algorithms.
README.md: Project documentation.

⚙️ Installation & Setup
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/mohit012345/movie-recommendation-system.git
cd movie-recommendation-system

Install Required Packages Make sure you have Python 3.6+ and install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter Notebook

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
🧠 How It Works
The recommendation system is based on a hybrid approach:

Collaborative Filtering: Analyzes user interactions (ratings) to recommend movies liked by similar users.
Content-Based Filtering: Suggests movies with similar genres, actors, or other attributes to the ones a user likes.
Example Usage
python
Copy code
# Import the recommendation function
from src.recommendations import hybrid_recommend

# Get recommendations for a movie
hybrid_recommend('The Dark Knight')
📊 Evaluation
The model is evaluated using standard recommendation metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and precision at K to measure the quality of recommendations.
